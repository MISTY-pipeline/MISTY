Things Still To Do:

1) Decide which galaxy properties we would like to be searchable in the header
2) Decide how to handle non-cosmological sims in this process
3) Add units to the rest of the spectrum columns
4) Confirm handling expected output from component fitting correctly
5) Generate the tau-weighted simulated values
